<i>This is always evolving. Not in place. Existence therefore Death. Feedback is wanted, but avenue is scarce. No succumbing to your standards and hopes for the world or these words.</i>

<h1>Hand Holding Manifesto</h1>

We must scratch notes no more. <br>

I want to start by saying welcome to a new era. Ferrets are bad pets. The clock stops at noon for a break. Broken clocks are right twice a day but broken sun dials are never right. Broken means different, different is always right. <br>

Hunger is the best sauce but i prefer salt. Breaks are breaking our system...good. We must fight the ideals of wealth in a pursuit of complete self reliance, equality, and the highest degree of free will. Yelling is left for the forgotten, but we have to remember. <br>

I don't like that i like mint chocolate ice cream. I am not happy with what makes me happy anymore; an escape is eminent. I am tired of marketing being used as a weapon in order to deliver the consumer to the producer. We no longer buy products, we are the product. We are now data being used as a means of profit in order to create more and more profit. The progression of humanity is now about how to control the progress of humanity. <br>

I hope our hopes are realigned; when does the change happen? The thing i want my hopes to align with are very general, and i'd like them to be more specific. Three more years of this? I don’t want it! <br>

We will bring you hope for what you don’t know you need. The answers for questions you don’t know yet. The keys to doors not yet built. This world is waiting, but not. I hope therefore I live. I live therefore I die. <br>

We must stop pretending there is a deeper meaning. Happiness comes and goes. The frog lives and dies. The human consumes and consumes and consumes and consumes. <br>

In some circles people may demand and encourage better consumption. We force it to you. You must yield to the flow of our necessary and pertinent information. Or we will force feed you unbeknownst to whom ever disconsumes.<br>

My back feels very straight while I kneel down and write this. I’m kneeling because the computer needs to be charged. What types of ceremonies can we have on a computer? Probably many since it's all still based around charge: but that doesn't mean much. The computer still needs to be charged though.<br>

Who is to say we have the right tools for proper existence? Who is to say we don’t? How do we escape the unrelenting force of information? What if we turn out to be right about a bliss? How do we feel about our existence? Sad! Mad! Unhappy! Longing for meaning!<br>

Here is the time and reasons motivating change. A change in media leads to a change in psyche. We will control and demand the medialic cognitive decay that erodes our inner synapses and morals.<br>

The anthropocene is here to stay. We must adjust our media milieu to present the best way to live. The media is our escape. The escape is frivolous, but frivolity is life.<br>

When we blink we lose sight. We blink very often. No sight for us anymore. Sight does not prove possible at this instant because capitalism is always surveilling, even when we blink and lose our sight. Capitalism refuses to cease. It refuses to loose in our staring contest that always defeats the consumers. All the consumers never garner the accolades that capitalism does.<br>

Our pest control can be natural. Our escapism can just be existence. Our media must be our champion. Communication capitalism controls and commandeers our ability to achieve bliss and a higher knowing. It is not possible for the ignorant consumer to be permitted control over their unwithering flows of media and information.<br>

We are purposefully blinded from seeing the signals of our societal decay. A cooperative is now invalid. Totalitarian media must take of our psyche. The democrative milieu necessitates feudalisms.<br>

Our systems are the rightful and false premier influencers on today’s past days. You and you are no longer separate: they are singular entities parallel and perpendicular simultaneously. The simultaneous is time. The narratives of media, horror movies, perpetrated by the time and ghosts because darkness is the only conspiracy.<br>

        “Celebrate” they say, but “celebration” is never possible with media garged down our ears, eyes, and noses. We are only entities to be forced to exist in the dichotomies of our worlds. The end is near, the answers unknownable, submit to the prentenion. Time is ticking <br>

        We are an Instagram Biography that is written by someone else. Most say it is a Biography, but did someone else write it? It is really a Biography? The CEO produces these “biographies” for us, but that is Mark Zuckerburg after all? <br>

        Don’t pause to think anymore! You must not question the words or sentences we create. Here we raise questions and unbeknownst to you brainwash in answers.

New media unknowingly force fed from us to us and eventually me and you and you and our pets.<br>
